# Wizz

Discover never-before-seen expanses of the world with Viz.
Wizz is a magic mod for Minecraft that changes the enchanting mechanics, adding the mechanics of reassessment and alchemy.

## Current plans:
* Mechanics for adjusting the cauldron (Alchemt Cauldron) temperature, interaction of the daytime with the cauldron, other minor updates for the cauldron.
* Rework Exaltations and bring them back.
* Rework the Enchanted Guardian and return it.
* Add direct interaction with Wizz.
* Port to 1.20.4 Neoforge. Highest priority.

## Version for 1.16.5

[Enhanced Enchanting](https://github.com/supcm/EnhancedEnchanting), a mod that was originally supposed to change only the enchanting system, has strayed too far from its original concept. Therefore, a rebranding was carried out.
